During the pandemic, I was heavily involved in the [response for COVID-19 from Stanford Health](https://med.stanford.edu/covid19.html). Our team, a mix of Stanford Engineering + Stanford Hospital faculties and students worked closely in a fast pace in dealing with
* Medical resource planning for Stanford Hospital and LPCH
* Regional pandemic projection

where I co-led the hospital projects.

Our tools can be found in the [SURF website](https://surf.stanford.edu/covid-19-tools/) (on demand) and here is a [summary](https://icme.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9731/f/peterglynn.pdf) of our analytics.

Among [many many others](https://tengz-sudo.github.io/covid-collaborators/), I want to give special thanks to our collaborator [Dr. Kristan Staudenmayer](https://profiles.stanford.edu/kristan-staudenmayer) from Stanford Hospital who always supported our work bridging the gap between the engineering and medical world.

The team's effort was covered by [_The Wall Street Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-pandemic-spurs-stanford-researchers-to-create-hospital-resource-calculator-11586251801), [_The Stanford Daily_](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/04/15/researchers-develop-calculator-to-project-resource-shortages-for-policy-makers-hospitals/) and [_Stanford Engineering_](https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/article/new-covid-19-calculator-designed-help-hospitals-prepare).
