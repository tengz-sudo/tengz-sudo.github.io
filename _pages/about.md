I am a fifth-year Ph.D. in the Department of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford (since 2016). I am fortunate to be advised by [Peter Glynn](https://web.stanford.edu/~glynn/) and [Jose Blanchet](https://web.stanford.edu/~jblanche/).

I am broadly interested in theory and applications of data-driven decision under uncertainty. My research lies in the interplay between optimization, stochastic modeling and machine learning. Recently, I have developed my interest in healthcare management and hospital operations working with [David Scheinker](https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-scheinker) at [SURF](https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-scheinker).

Prior to Stanford, I received my Bachelor's degree in Applied Math at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). During my last two years of undergrad, I also studied in [Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences (RIIS) at SHUFE](http://riis.shufe.edu.cn/), where I met my undergrad advisors [Dongdong Ge](http://riis.shufe.edu.cn/english/hospitaldetail.aspx?id=3&category_id=22), [Simai He](http://riis.shufe.edu.cn/english/hospitaldetail.aspx?id=6&category_id=22), [Bo Jiang](http://riis.shufe.edu.cn/english/hospitaldetail.aspx?id=14&category_id=22) and [Chris Ryan](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/christopher-thomas-ryan).

In my free time, I enjoy casual badminton, mountain running/hiking and (randomly) playing around with my guitar.
